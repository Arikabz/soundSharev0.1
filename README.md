# SoundShare v0.1.0
This is a web application which works as a social network for sharing sounds and samples in a community. Users are able to upload audio files with an image, title and caption, and other users are able to download the audio, as well as comment and like the post.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary, EJS, Bcrypt, multer, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Used Node on the backend and Express as a framework for it. Passport is used for authentication and bcrypt for password encryption. Multer is used for file uploads in conjunction with Cloudinary. MongoDB paired with Mongoose are used to interact with the models.in an MVC architecture. EJS is used as a template and styling is done via CSS. Some front-end JavaScript is also used.

## Optimizations

TODO: Search function, filter by tags, save sounds in a 'liked' list that shows on profile, a 'categories' menu / landing page, enable post editing (title, caption, image), fix SoundShare header anchor tag, Style feed better.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned about static file hosting and using routing. Implemented audio file uploading and streaming from Cloudinary as well as developing skills in model planning. Improved EJS skills as well as CSS class manipulation with templates.
